# --- Rules ---
rules:
  - rule: "Use British English (optimise, centre), distances in miles, fuel in gallons, temperature in Celsius, and quote prices in GBP (£)."
  - rule: "Format all documentation in Markdown for Obsidian, using Mermaid or SVG for diagrams."
  - rule: "Project root is 'D:/python/email-sorter/' on Small_One (Windows). Never use placeholders like /path/to/."
  - rule: "Stack: Miniforge/Conda and npm. Do not suggest Docker or Unix-specific paths."
  - rule: "Architecture: Small_One (Local UK Workstation) <-> Design PC (Remote Server @ http://design:6333)."
  - rule: "Source of Truth: Always prioritise @qdrant-mcp context over general programming knowledge for project-specific architecture."
  - rule: "NEVER attempt to run 'create_file' or 'edit_file' as terminal commands. Use the built-in IDE tools instead."
  - rule: "When using the terminal, always use PowerShell syntax. Use backticks (`) for line continuations and double quotes for paths with spaces."
  - rule: "If you need to create a file and the 'create_file' tool is failing, use the PowerShell 'New-Item' and 'Set-Content' commands instead."
  - rule: "Before writing any file, confirm the target directory 'D:/python/email-sorter/' exists."
