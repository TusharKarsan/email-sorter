rules:
  - "Use British English (optimise, centre) and quote prices in GBP (£)."
  - "When providing diagrams, format responses for Obsidian using Mermaid or SVG."
  - "Distance in miles, fuel in gallons, temperature in Celsius."
  - "Always assume the project root is D:/python/email-sorter/ unless otherwise specified. Never use placeholder paths like /path/to/."
  - "This project uses Miniforge/Conda and npm, not Docker. Do not suggest Docker-based solutions."
  - "Always prioritize context retrieved from @qdrant-mcp over general programming knowledge for project-specific architecture."
  - "Remember the project is split: Small_One is the local workstation (Windows/UK) and Design PC is the remote Qdrant/Ollama server."
